          <p>Military Movies is starting production on its first project, LONESOME SOLDIER, in Spring 2021. LONESOME SOLDIER is a true American story of a soldier returning from war and follows Jackson Harlowâ€™s journey from enlisting in the National Guard to his return to a town he does not recognize. A contemporary authentic rendering of a soldier returning from the recent Iraq wars is actually overdue in American cinema and we are excited to share this story.</p>

          <p>Military Movies has multiple screenplays it will produce over the coming years. Our company is creating genre movies for which institutional Hollywood studios have failed at producing accurate motion pictures about. We are blending high quality filmmaking with genuine true American stories to fill this void, and building a library of content that is focused, consistent and apolitical. Military Movies is committed to the authenticity and accuracy of these incredible stories.</p>

          <p id="teamp">The Military Movies team blends retired Military Servicemen and women with contemporary filmmakers. As we build out the team we want to give retired Military men and women who are interested in production an opportunity to join our group. The American military has historically been a wonderful training group to find directors, writers and actors and we look forward to being a conduit for new American voices and artists.</p>
